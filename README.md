### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Ozan Yanak
#### I am Software Engineer

My name is Ozan and I'm a final year software engineering student at FIRAT University in Turkey. I am passionate about web development, as well as game and mobile app development, and I am constantly striving to improve my skills in these areas.

Currently, I am participating in a six-month bootcamp program organized by Turkcell, where I am focusing on honing my skills in web development, particularly in Java backend development. Throughout the bootcamp, I have had the opportunity to learn from some amazing teachers, including Engin DemiroÄŸ and Burak KalaycÄ±.

I am thrilled to be part of this program and to continue learning and growing in the field of software development. With each passing day, I am becoming more confident in my abilities, and I am excited about the prospect of putting my newfound knowledge into practice.

Thank you for taking the time to read my profile, and I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with you.
